# CS_250
Module 8 Journal

After my time in CS-250 I've realized the importance of the Agile methodology. I find that short development periods that produce working code has many benefits.
It keeps the project focused on producing the Minimal Viable Product or MVP. After the MVP is delivered it allows for users, testers, developers, stakeholders, or anyone else to
test the program and provide feedback.  I've learned feedback is returned in the form of User Stories.  User Stories are essential to developing a good program that caters to 
the needs of the user. User stories provide errors that may need fixing, important feature requests, or any other issue a user might have with the program.

To be a good teammate in a software development role to me means many different things to me. I think at the forefront good communication skills are essential.
One must be able to communicate with other developers, testers, any other team members, and at times with users, the product owner, and even stakeholders.
I find it is also essential to be able to perform your duties well as well as being a well rounded team member that may be able to fulfil the roles
of others should that be necessary. In learning about Agile methodology I've seen the importance that while specialties exist it is still important to be well rounded in many areas.
